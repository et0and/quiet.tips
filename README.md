# Quiet Tips

Quiet Tips is an online resource designed to help those looking for some quiet time-out in their lives, if only for a brief moment. The design follows a simple chat interface, allowing for information to unfold as a "conversation" thread that can be looked through one piece at a time ([inspired much by this great article by Benjamin Keyser](https://www.intercom.com/blog/killer-feature-messaging-no-ones-talking/))

Designed and written by [Tom Hackshaw](https://tom.org.nz), and based on the excellent original work of [Stephen Kirster](https://with.sk)'s [codebase](https://github.com/mutableui/mutableui.github.io)
